Here's a README template for your GitHub project detailing the time series forecasting model for predicting ambulance call volumes:

# Time Series Forecasting for Ambulance Call Volumes

## Overview
This project develops a time series forecasting model using real-world data from Jakarta to predict monthly ambulance call volumes. The models are designed to assist in emergency service planning by predicting future demand accurately.

## Features
- **Baseline Model**: Implemented using Linear Regression and Moving Average (MA) techniques to establish initial forecasting accuracy.
- **Intermediate Models**: Employed Holt's Linear and ARIMA models to improve prediction accuracy over the baseline model.
- **Final Model**: Developed advanced rolling forecasts using Holt-Winters and SARIMAX models to capture seasonal trends and autocorrelation for precise predictions.

## Performance Metrics
- The models were rigorously tested and validated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to ensure the accuracy of forecasts.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Statsmodels
- Pandas
- NumPy
